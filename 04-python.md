#Python

Python is a programming langauge commonly used in bioinformatics

While its syntax is simpler than other programming languages it is quite powerful

In our lab we use Python for parsing files, and other tasks that are too complicated to be done with the command line.

#Very Basic Python

To get started with Python, we'll use the interactive shell. 

To open it, simply type `python`

You should see some information about your Python install, and a prompt that looks like `>>>`

#Expressions

Expression can be evaluated on the Python shell like `2+2` or `'hello' + ' world'` or `max([1,2,4])`

**Instructions**  
Try inputting a few of the above expressions.  
Try inputting a few of your own, and see what happens.

#Types

Values in Python are assigned to a type.

Types allow Python to know what opperations are allowed, and how to behave.

For example `+` on Ints, Floats, or Longs (number types) acts as addition. 
On Strings `+` acts as concatonation. 

You can check the type of a value or expression by using the `type()` function, like `type(3)`

You can convert between types using functions like `int()`, `float()` or `str()`

**Instructions**  
Check the types of a few of the expressions you previously used  
Try converting `3` to a float, and try converting `3` to a string  

#Variables
